    <p>Contemporary Allied Racing is a racing game built for iOS and Android. It includes fictional racing teams and tracks.
        I did the 3D art and programming, while outsourcing the music to a contact in Boston.

    <h1>Technical challenges</h1>
    <p>Probably the two biggest challenges were the AI drivers and the steering. Having the AI drivers know when to brake 
        and turn was difficult. This was my first project that had extensive AI, and it had to work with the car physics. 
        The steering was difficult because everyone who playtested the game had a different taste of the steering. As a 
        result, there was a lot of tuning the settings for the steering.
    </p>
    <h1>Lessons learned</h1>
    <p>As this was the personal project I worked on during college, the things I learned influenced the project. 
        Feedback is incredibly important for any game, not just this one. Documentation is also extremely important. 
    </p>
    <h1>Future work</h1>
    <p>More tracks, more cars, better AI, improved multiplayer, and better optimizations</p>
