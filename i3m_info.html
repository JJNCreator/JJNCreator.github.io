    <h1>Technical challenges</h1>
    <p>The two biggest challenges were getting the Addressables (layer on top of AssetBundles) to work 
        and getting the vehicles to work. The Addressables were used for uploading/downloading remote AssetBundles from S3 
    to load content dynamically. This occasionally had some issues such as memory leaks, low frame rates, and disconnects. 
The vehicles (which the player could interact with and drive in) were difficult to set up at first, but they improved after a 
few iterations. </p>
<h1>Lessons learned</h1>
<p>Being on a smaller team can be a challenge. Communication is key in this scenario. I also learned to have code reviews 
    with the other developers and artists.
