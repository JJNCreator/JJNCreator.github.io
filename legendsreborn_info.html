    <h1>Technical challenges</h1>
    <p>Some issues I ran into were getting the UI to align with the mockups. This resulted in several iterations of 
        the menus I worked on. I also ran into some issues with setting up the analytics.
    </p>
    <h1>Lessons learned</h1>
    <p>Communication is incredibly important, especially in remote work. One thing I learned was that with Perforce, you 
        need to make sure another team member isn't already looking at the file you want to edit. This caused a couple sync issues 
        during my early days on the project.
