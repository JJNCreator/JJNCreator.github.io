    <p>Mythical Freaks is a 2D fighter made in Unity. In the game, you play as a cryptid and fight other cryptids. I did all the
        programming while outsourcing the art and music to a couple college classmates.

    <h1>Contributions</h1>
    <p>Gameplay mechanics, character animation, managing version control, UI, platform deployment, localization</p>
    <h1>Software used</h1>
    <p>Unity, Visual Studio, Photoshop, Git, Inkscape, XCode, Android Studio, Amazon CodeCommit</p>
    <h1>Technical challenges</h1>
    <p>Some of the issues I ran into were getting the animations to work properly. I also had 
        trouble with setting up server-side receipt validation, though it's more secure than local validation.</p>
    <h1>Lessons learned</h1>
    <p>One thing I learned is art can be difficult to make iterations for, especially when it
        hasn't been updated in a while. I also learned that fighting games can be tough to perfect.</p>
    <h1>Future work</h1>
    <p>Local multiplayer, better animations, more characters and stages, finishing moves, 
        cheat codes, AI improvements, and save system optimizations</p>
